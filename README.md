# React + TypeScript + Vite

This is my first TypeScript project. I will follow the instructions from my teacher, Sebastian Tegel, after have watched him code the same project today in class. 

The project is very simple: a todo list where you can mark them as done, create new ones, and delete existing ones.

I expect to adopt TypeScript as my first choice for JavaScript project as it seems simpler to develop.
